# README for Shamir's Secret Sharing Interface

## Overview

This project is a web-based interface for implementing Shamir's Secret Sharing scheme, allowing users to upload a JSON file containing encoded values and retrieve the secret (constant term) using Lagrange interpolation. The UI features a modern dark orange theme with a minimalistic design.

## Features

- **File Upload**: Users can select and upload a JSON file through a styled button.
- **Lagrange Interpolation**: The application computes the secret using the Lagrange interpolation method based on the data extracted from the JSON file.
- **Responsive Design**: The interface is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring usability on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Aesthetic UI**: The design is modern, utilizing a dark theme with vibrant orange accents for a visually appealing user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: The structure of the web page is defined using HTML5.
- **CSS**: Custom styling is applied using CSS to create a modern and aesthetic UI.
- **JavaScript**: The logic for file reading, JSON parsing, and Lagrange interpolation is implemented in JavaScript.

## Code Explanation

### HTML Structure

- The main HTML document is structured with a `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration, ensuring it adheres to HTML5 standards.
- The `<head>` section includes metadata such as character set, viewport settings for responsiveness, and the title of the page.
- The `<body>` contains a centered container for the UI components.

### CSS Styling

- **Global Reset**: Margins, paddings, and box-sizing are reset for a consistent layout across browsers.
- **Body Styling**: A dark background color is set with a flexbox layout for centering.
- **Container**: A card-like layout is used for the main content area, with rounded corners and a shadow effect for depth.
- **Button Styling**: The file upload button is styled for better aesthetics and user experience, including hover effects.
- **Output Area**: The output message area is styled to provide a clear, distinguishable space for results.

### JavaScript Functionality

- **Function Definitions**:
  - `decodeValue(value, base)`: Converts encoded values from various bases to decimal.
  - `lagrangeInterpolation(points, k)`: Computes the secret using Lagrange interpolation based on the provided points.
  - `processFile(event)`: Handles the file upload, reads the JSON content, extracts relevant data, and performs the interpolation to retrieve the secret.
  
- **Event Listeners**: An event listener is attached to the file input to trigger the processing of the uploaded file.

## Usage Instructions

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Click on the "Choose File" button to upload a JSON file that contains encoded values for Shamir's Secret Sharing.
3. After selecting a file, the calculated constant term (secret 'c') will be displayed on the screen.

## JSON File Structure

The JSON file must follow this structure:

```json
{
    "keys": {
        "n": 9,
        "k": 6
    },
    "1": {
        "base": "10",
        "value": "28735619723837"
    },
    "2": {
        "base": "16",
        "value": "1A228867F0CA"
    },
    ...
}
```

- `keys`: Contains `n` (total number of shares) and `k` (minimum shares needed to reconstruct the secret).
- Each entry (e.g., `"1"`, `"2"`, ...) represents a share with its base and encoded value.
